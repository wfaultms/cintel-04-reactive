# Interactive Analytics with Shiny

Earlier, you installed Python and verified it with:

```shell
python --version
python3 --version
py --version
```

Use the command that works instead of `python` in the following instructions. 
You're encouraged to modify these Markdown (.md) files to reflect the commands that work on your machine. 

## Install and Upgrade Python Tools Globally

Install some additional content into your global Python for best results. 
open your terminal (PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux) and
install these to your default Python using the commands below. 


```shell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel
python -m pip install --upgrade black ruff pyright
python -m pip install --upgrade rsconnect-python
```

You must have reconnect-python installed for the next step.

## Authorize shinyapps.io

Using Chrome (recommended), sign in to your free shinyapps.io account (I use GitHub to sign in.)

1. On the Getting Started page, click on the "Start with Python" tab.

## Create a Virtual Environment

```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

When VS Code asks if it should add the new virtual environment, click yes.


## Activate the Virtual Environment

- Activate it on Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
- Activate it on macOS/Linux `source .venv/bin/`

## Install Libaries into Virtual Environment

This gives a good selection of options. You only need to install the ones you use.

```shell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel shiny shinyswatch 
python -m pip install --upgrade pandas openpyxl jinja2 matplotlib seaborn plotnine
python -m pip install --upgrade shinywidgets plotly holoviews panel hvplot ipyleaflet
python -m pip install --upgrade jupyter_bokeh 

```

OR List your requirements in requirements.txt and install them all at once.

```shell
python -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```


## Run the App

Verify your virtual environment is activated. Run the app. 

```shell
shiny run --reload app.py
```

Open the app by following the instructions provided in the terminal. 
For example, try CRTL CLICK (at the same time) on the URL displayed (http://127.0.0.1:8000).

Hit CTRL c (at the same time) to quit the app. 
If it won't stop, close the terminal window.
Reopen the terminal window and be sure the virtual environment is activated
before running the app again.
